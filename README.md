Build Details: Our app in its current stage of development is being run on a virtual android device through Android Studio. This will require android studio and setup of a new AVD in android studio. The AVD Manager can be accessed through the tools menu and android submenu in android studio. The device we have tested on is a Nexus 5 with API level 24, running Nougat, Android 7.0 (w/Google APIs). Another device type is possible to use, but it is necessary to have at least this API level and Android version, with Google APIs, at the moment. This may require enabling of virtualization on windows devices, which requires a small change to the UEFI settings. (Documentation on this change, if necessary, found here: http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-other_settings/cannot-find-the-option-to-enable-intel-vt-x-in/c9203f8a-da57-43be-8c75-cfe43d55cd70 ) If the provided documentation isn't useful feel free to contact our team members and we will assist. Building with gradle, once this is all set up, through android studio and then running on a AVD.
